# **L-System Application** üå≥‚ú®

## **Overview**  
I've developed an interactive application on **L-Systems** using the **p5.js** web tool. This application not only demonstrates the concept and coding of L-Systems but also showcases the creative potential of designing with them. The system I've built goes beyond simply generating tree structures; it allows for extensive customization, enabling users to create personalized trees using mathematical logic. This way, the application offers both an educational insight into **L-Systems** and a platform for artistic expression.

The system provides users with three pre-programmed tree styles, which can be extensively customized using multiple **GUI** features. Users can adjust various parameters such as size, values, wind, colors, branches, curvature, and more. This flexibility allows users to not only learn about L-Systems but also to explore and experiment with different design outcomes, enhancing their understanding and creativity.

The system I created incorporates logic from various sources, such as:

## **üîß Technical Aspects**  
Developed using **p5.js** on the local web with **JavaScript**, this project leverages the theoretical foundations laid by **Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz**. The technical aspects involve not only coding the logic but also applying mathematical principles. The result is a system that combines math and code to create visually appealing and customizable **L-System trees**. This artistic approach allows users to save their creations and learn about L-Systems in an engaging and interactive manner.

Below is a display of the main designs created using the system. These photos show what can be achieved through user interaction, where tapping or clicking generates the tree. Users can then customize their creations with the **GUI** features.
