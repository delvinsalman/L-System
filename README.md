# L-System Application

## Overview
I've developed an interactive application on L-Systems using the p5.js web tool. This application not only demonstrates the concept and coding of L-Systems but also showcases the creative potential of designing with them. The system I've built goes beyond simply generating tree structures; it allows for extensive customization, enabling users to create personalized trees using mathematical logic. This way, the application offers both an educational insight into L-Systems and a platform for artistic expression.

The system provides users with three pre-programmed tree styles, which can be extensively customized using multiple GUI features. Users can adjust various parameters such as size, values, colors, branches, curvature, and more. This flexibility allows users to not only learn about L-Systems but also to explore and experiment with different design outcomes, enhancing their understanding and creativity.


The system I created incorporates logic from various sources, such as: https://paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/.
